# Round 1

Volunteers testing [The Perfect Circle!](http://michaelhoehle.eu/shiny/perfectcircle/) app please contribute your files as [ALIAS].jpg and [ALIAS].csv in this directory as pull-requests.

Please report feature requests and bug reports for the app as [github issues](https://github.com/hoehleatsu/perfectcircle/issues).

Note: If you know R then it's possible to run the app as well as it's underlying API locally by installing the [perfectcircle](https://github.com/hoehleatsu/perfectcircle) R package. See the github package for a guide on how to install it. This might also be considerably faster than to wait for a slow server.
